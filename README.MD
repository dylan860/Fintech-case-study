Circle is a peer-to-peer payment technology company that now manages a very popular stablecoin USDC. This is a cryptocurrency that is valued to the price of one United States dollar. The Company was founded by Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville in October 2013. Circle currently is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts.[1][2] USDC is currently valued at over $36 billion.[3][4][5]

The company Circle Internet Company Ltd was incorporated in 2013

The founders of the company are Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville.

The idea was brought to fruition by the need for a digital stable coin pegged to the price of 1.00 USD. After the crash from Mt Gox which led to nearly 400 million worth of Bitcoin being lost.

Circle Internet Financial Ltd received approximately 135 million from approximately 4 rounds of Venture Capital funding. Today Circles total funding amount is 1.1 Billion.

Circle Internet Financial Ltd would like to be the go to for Institutional financial Investors. Circle would like to be the first choice for a stable digital currency. Circle Internet Financial Ltd is solving multiple problems such as having a safe and secure digital currency that will remain the price of 1 U.S dollar while also maintaining a platform in which developer's can build a totally new platform on top of.

The company's intended customers are everyone from Institutional investors to a normal person only trading a few dollars. Circle's USDC is a safe bet for anyone looking to trade digital currency in a safe and secure manner. According to Forbes Circle USDC is the second largest digital dollar pegged token in the world and has a $49 Billion market cap. 

Circle offers scalability and safety concerning a pegged digital dollar. Circle is publicly traded in the U.S which means it has the liquidity to ensure safety and security. there is a few other similar companies such as, Bilibit, Bitpanda, NairaX, Tether (USDT) & (BUSD). They are not publicly traded and would not be scrutinized as much as Circle.

Circle USDC currently utilizes Blockchain technology. Circle is currently using 29 technology products and services including: HTML5, jQuery, and Google Analytics this is according to G2 Stack.

Circle Internet Company is in the Cryptocurrency and Blockchain domain.

Blockchain and fintech has been the definition of innovation in this domain for the last 5-10 years. After the fall of Terra Luna. Innovation and transparency was a must to gain trust in a space that is in desperate need of regulation and transparency. 

Circle's USDC stablecoin is #2 compared to Tether's (USDT).
Another example of the largest stable crypto currency goes to Tether (USDT) which has the largest market cap of both Circles USDC and Tether coming in a #1. Presently Tether accounts for approximately 53% of the total stable coin market Cap where Circle's USDC market cap makes up 31%, followed by Binance (BUSD). 

The business impacts of USDC will only continue to push innovation forward. I believe cryptocurrency is only getting started. I love that transparency and trust play such a big role in USDC as this company will certainly only gain momentum and popularity.

I would imagine that a stable coin should be backed by actual physical assets such as gold and rare minerals. I think with the fall of other stable coins such as Terra Luna we should develop a full proof system that would be very safe although the funds in USDC and USDT are significant I think they still run the rick associated with fractional reserve banking. I think the bank runs happening now with traditional finance is a serious matter and fractional reserve banking in not good for our current and future financial system.

I think that offering a stablecoin backed by actual assets will ensure that they are leading in innovation by doing away with the current fractional reserve policy.

I do not believe it will need other technologies different than Blockchain. I believe in trust and transparency and I do believe Blockchain will take us where traditional finance cannot.
